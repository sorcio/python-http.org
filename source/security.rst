Security Contact
================

If you have a security flaw or concern that a member project should be
made aware of you may send an email to ``security@python-http.org`` and
we will respond to you promptly.  For encrypted messaging we also provide
all available member's Keybase accounts.

The Working Group will contact the relevant maintainers and work with them
to provide a resolution to the security issue while keeping the reporter in
the loop. No patches or issues will be posted publicly until releases are
ready to be made.
